superuser can create universities. for that first they will create a user in users table, then create a university in universities table
at the time a superuser is creating a university, he will know the no. of guides and students under it (bcoz it is fixed for every academic year)
this will be done by the django admin panel

then university can manually create guides through their dashboard

then university can manually create students through their dashboard and while creating it, 
they can manually link each student to a guide OR they can even keep the guide field empty
